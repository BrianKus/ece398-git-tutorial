# Git Repo Explanation

This repository is designed to act as a demo for Git and GitHub.

## `README` File

A "README" file is a convention by programmers, indicating to the viewer
that there is important information in this file you should be aware of.

This can include build instructions, security, licensing information, and other
documentation. The README file may also point you to other documentation sources.

## `LICENSE` File

The LICENSE file in a git repository is where you tell others how they can
or cannot use your code. For our purposes in ECE398, pick the MIT license.
